A small, still WIP Dungeon Crawler Game using Forms. This was a project for one of my classes where we were to design a program that had to meet the criteria below:

1. 4-5 forms
2. Get some DateTime input
3. Export to Excel or Database any form of data from the program
While this started out as a fun project, I want to expand on it and plan to do much more with it as time goes on. 
I am open to any feedback and additions taken. This can be an Open Source Dungeon Crawler game that anyone can be involved in the ever evolving storyline of it. 
I've laid out the basis and plan on going back to fill in the details more. But for now, this the program in its finished state.
